<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>When it comes to extracurricular activites, I certainly have a lot of interests. For the sake of brevity, here's a list of some of the things I enjoy doing</p>

<ul>
    <li>Gaming (I enjoy mostly shooters, but also dabble in adventure rpgs)</li>
    <li>Spending time with my girlfiend (She's also a gamer!)</li>
    <li>Playing with my sphynx cat (His name is Odin)</li>
    <li>Surfing with the boys (This is usually every saturday, I ride a 7'2)</li>
    <li>Crossfit (When I'm not doing other productive things)</li>
    <li>Flying my drone (DJI Mini 3)</li>
    <li>Developing Websites (I've recently  started learning, but this brings me joy)</li>


</ul>
